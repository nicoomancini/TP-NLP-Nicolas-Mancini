A diferencia de KNN, el rendimiento es consistente entre todas las clases, sin caídas marcadas en precisión o recall.\n",

Esta decisión se basa en minimizar el consumo de tokens, sacrificando el margen de robustez del LLM a costa de obtener un modelo más rápido, eficiente y escalable. Dado que el modelo de embeddings ya proporciona una representación semántica rica, KNN logra explotar directamente las distancias en el espacio vectorial sin necesidad de un procesamiento generativo costoso, manteniéndose como una opción altamente competitiva y confiable para la clasificación de intenciones en producción.\n"
